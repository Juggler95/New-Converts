            You’ve just made the most important decision of your life — to
            follow Jesus. In this moment, your sins are forgiven, and you’ve
            been made new. You are now part of God’s family. You may not feel
            different yet, but a powerful change has taken place in your heart.
            God has started something beautiful in you, and He will help you
            grow.

          The true God is the one who created everything — and He knows you by
          name. He is loving, holy, and good. He sent His Son, Jesus, to save us
          and bring us back into relationship with Him. God isn’t distant or
          angry — He wants to walk with you every day and show you who He is
          through His Word and His Spirit.
